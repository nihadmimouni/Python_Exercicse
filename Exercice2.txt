Exercise 2: 

1. Problem Identification:
The problem is to design a modular framework for Numerical Integration. This system allows approximating the definite integral of a mathematical function over a specific interval [a, b] using different numerical techniques.

2. Static Properties and Behaviors:
Object: NumericalIntegrator

- Static Properties:
    * lower_limit (float): The start of the interval 'a'.
    * upper_limit (float): The end of the interval 'b'.
    * intervals (int): Number of sub-intervals (n) for the partition.
    * target_function: The mathematical function f(x) to be integrated.

- Behavior:
    * compute_step_size(): Calculates the width h = (b - a) / n.
    * integrate(): An abstract operation to execute the numerical approximation.

3. Inheritance and Polymorphism:

- Inheritance:
A base class called "Integrator" contains the shared attributes (a, b, n). We then derive specific subclasses for each numerical method:
    * Class TrapezoidalRule: Inherits from Integrator.
    * Class SimpsonsRule: Inherits from Integrator.

- Polymorphism:
Polymorphism is implemented through the "integrate()" function. Although the method name is the same for all objects, the underlying algorithm changes depending on the class:
    * In TrapezoidalRule: It calculates the area using linear approximations for each sub-interval.
    * In SimpsonsRule: It calculates the area using parabolic arcs, providing higher accuracy for smooth functions.
